Welcome to LeetLog! This repository is a collection of LeetCode problems I‚Äôve solved along my coding journey. Here, you‚Äôll find solutions to various algorithmic challenges. Whether you‚Äôre preparing for interviews or brushing up on your coding skills, I hope this repository serves as a valuable resource.

## üìñ Introduction
LeetLog is aimed at providing clear and efficient solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems. Each problem will be categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and topic (Arrays, Linked Lists, Dynamic Programming, etc.). I strive to write clean, readable code and include comments to explain the thought process behind each solution. 


## üìù Problem List

Here‚Äôs a quick look at the problems covered in this repository:

| #   | Title                                         | Difficulty | Category                             |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) | Easy       | Arrays and Hashing      |
| 2   | [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) | Easy     | Arrays and Hashing |
| 3   | [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | Easy     | Arrays and Hashing |



## üíª Code Details
- **ValidAnagram.py**: sorted() function will sort both the strings in the same fashion and then we can compare both for equality.
- **ContainsDuplicate.py**: set() function will contain unique list items. If the length of the string doesn't match the length of the set, it contains duplicates.
- **TwoSum.py**: using hashmap we can reduce the time complexity of this problem
